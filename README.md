# Circulearn

#### Instructions:
Circulearn is a Javascript matching game which challenges the users memory. Similar circular objects will appear briefly before fading to grey.  Each time the user correclty matches a pair the board grows in size thereby increasing the difficulty of the game and the user's score.  The user starts with 3 lives and loses a life when matching a pair incorrectly.  The game ends when the user runs out of lives.
